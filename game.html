                To play the game you can click on the canvas above and either press "1" for single player or 
                "2" for two players. The controls for single player are just the arrow keys, but for two players
                the second set of controls are WASD. The goal for single player mode is to try and grow your snake as long 
                as possible by eating the circles. The goal for two players is each player has to fight for the circle and 
                if one of the players hits their opponent's tail they lose, or if they hit the borders they also lose.
                <br><br>This was built with Processing another object oriented language and is built on Java. I used arraylists to 
                create the snakes and the concept of polymorphism to create multiple shapes.
